# Getting Started

This section will walk you through the main features of `re-reduced` with practical examples:

In the following examples we'll be building a simple counter app.

## Defining a type system

`[root]/examples/Counter/types.ts`

```ts
export interface State {
  counter: number;
}
```


## Creating Actions

`[root]/examples/Counter/actions.ts`

```ts
import { createAction } from "re-reduced";

export default {
  adjust: createAction<number>("ADJUST"),
  decrement: createAction("DECREMENT"),
  increment: createAction("INCREMENT")
};
```

## Creating Reducers

`[root]/examples/Counter/reducers.ts`

```ts
import { combineReducers } from "redux";
import { handleActions } from "re-reduced";

import actions from "./actions";
import { State } from "./types";

const INITIAL_STATE = 0;

export const counter = handleActions<number>(
  [
    actions.increment.reduce(state => state + 1),
    actions.decrement.reduce(state => state - 1),
    actions.adjust.reduce((state, payload) => state + payload)
  ],
  INITIAL_STATE
);

export default combineReducers<State>({
  counter
});

```

## Creating selectors

```ts
import { createSelector } from "reselect";

import { State } from "./types";

export const getCounter = (state: State) => state.counter;

export const getCounterIsOdd = createSelector(
  getCounter,
  counter => counter % 2 !== 0
);

export const getCounterIsPositive = createSelector(
  getCounter,
  counter => counter >= 0
);
```

## Connecting a component

`[root]/src/ui/containers/Counter.tsx`

```ts
import * as React from "react";
import { connectWithActions } from "re-reduced";

import actions from "./actions";
import * as selectors from "./selectors";

interface Props {
  count: number;
  isOdd: boolean;
  isPositive: boolean;
  actions: typeof actions;
}

const Counter = (props: Props) => (
  <div>
    <button onClick={() => props.actions.decrement()}>-1</button>
    <button onClick={() => props.actions.adjust(-5)}>-5</button>
    <button
      disabled
      style={{
        color: props.isPositive ? (props.isOdd ? "blue" : "green") : "red",
        fontWeight: "bold",
        paddingLeft: 5,
        paddingRight: 5,
        width: 50
      }}
    >
      {props.count}
    </button>
    <button onClick={() => props.actions.adjust(5)}>+5</button>
    <button onClick={() => props.actions.increment()}>+1</button>
  </div>
);

const enhance = connectWithActions<Props>(actions, {
  count: selectors.getCounter,
  isOdd: selectors.getCounterIsOdd,
  isPositive: selectors.getCounterIsPositive
});

export default enhance(Counter);
```
