# Getting Started

This section will walk you through the main features of `re-reduced` with practical examples:

In the following examples we'll be building a simple counter app.

## Creating Actions

`[root]/src/domain/counter/actions.ts`

```ts
import { createAction, createAsyncAction } from "re-reduced"

export default {
  increment: createAction("COUNTER:INCREMENT"),
  decrement: createAction("COUNTER:DECREMENT"),
  adjust: createAction<number>("COUNTER:ADJUST")
}
```

## Creating Reducers from Actions

`[root]/src/domain/counter/reducers.ts`

```ts
import { combineReducer } from "redux"
import { handleActions } from "re-reduced"

import actions from "./actions"

const INITIAL_STATE: number = 0

export default handleActions<number>(
  [
    actions.increment.reduce((state: number) => state + 1),
    actions.decrement.reduce((state: number) => state - 1),
    actions.adjust.reduce((state: number, payload: number) => state + payload),
  ],
  INITIAL_STATE
)
```

## Connecting a component

`[root]/src/ui/containers/Counter.tsx`

```ts
import * as React from "react";
import { connectWithActions } from "re-reduced";

import actions from "./actions";

interface Props {
  count: number;
  actions: typeof actions;
}

const Counter = (props: Props) => (
  <div>
    <div>Count: {props.count}</div>
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => props.actions.decrement()}>(-)</button>
      <button onClick={() => props.actions.increment()}>(+)</button>
      <button onClick={() => props.actions.adjust(5)}>(+5)</button>
      <button onClick={() => props.actions.adjust(-5)}>(-5)</button>
    </div>
  </div>
);

const enhance = connectWithActions<Props>(actions, {
  count: state => state
})

export default enhance(Counter)

```
