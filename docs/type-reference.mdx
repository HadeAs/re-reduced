# Type Reference: Core

## `Action`

Represent a Flux Standard Action (FSA) where the generic type T represents the action's payload

```ts
interface Action<T = void> {
  type: string;
  payload: T;
}
```

## `AsyncAction`

AsyncAction is both an [ActionCreator](#actioncreator) (of payload type TPayload) and an object with nested action-creators.

Those nested action-creators handle failable async workflows with `request`, `success` and `failure`.

AsyncAction is better used in conjuction with `Sagas`

---

`request(void)`: is dispatched imediately after a saga that handles an async action starts

`success(payload: TSuccess)`: is dispatched on a successful response from an api, and takes a payload of type `TSuccess`

`failure(payload: TError)`: is dispatched if an exception is throw, takes a payload of type `TError`

```ts
interface AsyncAction<TSuccess, TPayload = void, TError = Error>
  extends ActionCreator<TPayload> {
  request: ActionCreator;
  success: ActionCreator<TSuccess>;
  failure: ActionCreator<Error>;
}
```

## `ActionReducerMap`

```ts
interface ActionReducerMap<TState> {
  [key: string]: ActionReducer<TState, any>;
}
```

## `ActionReducer`

```ts
type ActionReducer<TState, TPayload> = (
  state: TState,
  payload: TPayload
) => TState;
```

## `ActionCreator`

```ts
interface ActionCreator<TPayload = void> {
  (): Action;
  (payload: TPayload): Action<TPayload>;
  type: string;
  reduce: <TState>(
    reducer: ActionReducer<TState, TPayload>
  ) => {
    [key: string]: ActionReducer<TState, TPayload>;
  };
}
```
